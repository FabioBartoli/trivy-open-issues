The southern region of Brazil is being heavily affected by flooding. Almost 70% of the municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul have been hit by floods and more than 120,000 people are currently unsheltered.

# Trivy Scan and Open Issues

This GitHub Action integrates Trivy vulnerability scanning into your workflow. It scans the filesystem for vulnerabilities based on the severity levels you specify and opens GitHub issues for any vulnerabilities found.

## When to use this Action?
If you use any version of Github Enterprise and want to take advantage of Aquasecurity's Trivy, you need to have the additional Github Code Scanning license to be able to generate the items in the "Security" tab
![security-advanced](./images/security.png)

With this Action, you can bypass the need to purchase Code Scanning if your company can't for some reason, so we've created issues for each of the vulnerabilities pointed out by Trivy![opened-issues](./images/opened-issues.png)

## Necessary settings
It is mandatory to use "issues: write" in your job that will be calling this action, in addition to passing the Github Token generated at runtime. 
Minimal requiriments example:

    jobs:
      scan:
        permissions:
	        issues: write
    name: scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
	- name: Checkout code
	uses: actions/checkout@v3
 
	- name: Trivy Scan
    uses: FabioBartoli/trivy-open-issues@v1.0.0
    with:
      github_token: ${{ github.token }}
